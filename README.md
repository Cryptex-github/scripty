Building the bot requires Nightly Rust, with `libdeepspeech.so` in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` 
and `LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables.

### It doesn't work on Windows!
Yeah I know. Windows support is not planned, nor will any PRs for it be accepted.
If you make one, it will be closed and **not** merged.
